# Archiving note

This was an attempt to set up some requirements for managing my dotfiles using
exclusively POSIX shell scripting. It was quite challenging and provided
inspiration for how I manage my configuration to this day.

However, `chezmoi` offers such flexibility and simplicity that maintaining a
custom set of POSIX scripts makes no sense, except perhaps in very simple
cases.


## Why this project

Every time I finish installing a new distribution on a (virtual) machine,
obvioulsy nothing I want is there... Having to reinstall the same software
suite repeatedly is frustrating, and managing the corresponding configuration
for those applications is even worse.

This project aims to minimize those tedious steps as much as possible
for every platform I intend or have to work with.

This is not about scripts that perform a fully automated operating system
installation, like a specific Linux distribution on a hard drive. The
requirements for a given machine or context may also vary each time, which is
why this is more focused to preparing a usable, familiar environment once the
core system installation is done.


## How does it work

This repository contains an `install.sh` script that takes a profile name as an
argument. A profile is simply any directory left at the root of that repository
and describe how that latter should be deployed on a target system.

When `install.sh` is run with a given profile, it will first identify the
system it is running on. Next, it will look for a plain text file in the
profile directory, corresponding to the detected system. That file should hold
all the software dependencies related to the configuration to be deployed, as
expected by the package manager.

Finally, the configuration deployment process is handled over the profile main
script, `_setup.sh`, which has to describe all the steps to deploy what it is
embedding.


## How to use

1. Install the system of your choice that is supported
2. Be sure the system has access to the internet
3. Update the system and eventually reboot
4. Install `git`
5. Clone this repository:
	`$> git clone https://github.com/duketuxem/os-bootstrap.git`
6. Change directory to it: `cd os-bootstrap/`
7. To install the core profile for example, run `install.sh core`
8. Eventually install other profiles or create your own !
9. Enjoy


## Implementation notes

### Design

Separating the installation from the configuration steps offers several
benefits:

1. **Generic Installation:** The installation part is generic and requires only
   a profile to list all software dependencies. This provides a clear view of
   what the profile expects to find already installed on a target, which can be
   any platform.
2. Standalone Configuration Deployment: The configuration deployment process
   operates as a standalone and self-contained routine. This separation allows
   the installation phase to focus on interacting with the package manager,
   while the configuration remains 'self-centered.'
3. **Independence of Processes:** Each process can be (re)played independently.
   However, the installation may suggest executing the corresponding profile
   subscript.

### Scripting

The `install.sh` script is written in pure shell to maximize portability,
avoiding dependencies on specific shell flavors like bash or zsh. Eventually,
it would be to extend support to Windows, provided a package manager is
available and other requirements are met. Currently, this is a possibility, and
for now, supporting a wide range of Linux distributions is beneficial. A minor
drawback is the need to search for package names in each distribution when
adding new software, but once a configuration is established, it should not
require constant attention.
